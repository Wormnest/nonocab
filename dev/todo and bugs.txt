NoNoCAB
========

23-4-2019: I saw that apparently NoNoCab was stuck in a possible endless loop.
It was building the first leg of a train line to an iron mine and due to other ais also building around there something went wrong.
Depending on how NoNoCab does the building the station at the iron mine was not built but the track stopped close to it.
Or the station at the iron mine was already deleted but NoNoCab got stuck trying to remove the rail.
Last Log message said execution of report was halted.
Looking at previous automatic saves it looks like it got stuck removing the rail tracks.
It looks like it got stuck removing rail track next to a lake on a piece of land that has different heights.

ALSO for WormAI.
OpenTTD master (future v 1.10) fixes a bug that we were taking advantage of:
We need to check which version is running and depending on that
turn that feature on or off.

problems with trains: getting less and less starting around 2020 on arctic
maybe because of no electric rail?

hi Wormnest , there is a problem with NoNoCAB trains, something wrong happens at around year 2028
<Wormnest> And what might that be Samu
<Samu> i recall these same problems in NoCAB v499
<Samu> well it does fine from 1950-2027~ish
<Samu> always profiting, making more trains, increasing company value etc
<Samu> then, at around that year, the profits started to decrease, the number of trains also 
<Samu> slowly...
<Samu> and it's now approaching the year 2051, and only has about 40 trains, down from 1000 in 2027
<Samu> it has been slowly selling them over the last 20 years
<Wormnest> Maybe the tracks are expiring, can´t remember when that happens nor if nonocab considers that
<Samu> let me investigate those savegames
<Samu> actually, it's not around 2027, it's a bit earlier
<Samu> yeah 2018, my bad
<Samu> i was off by 10 years :p
<Samu> there's still rail tracks
<Samu> and rail engines
<Samu> ok i see, it maxes out at around 2018, then there's a 4-5 year profits stagnates, and then from 2023 onwards it's only decreasing
<Samu> i dunno which savegames you're interested in
<Wormnest> not sure, don´t have time to look anyway currently
<Samu> https://imgur.com/4SRtWK1 
<Samu> the starting of its downfall
<Wormnest> Maybe the problems is that there´s no electric rail in arctic iirc
<Samu> there isn't
<Samu> this is how it looks like right now https://imgur.com/ahjSNEV 3 years from reaching 2051 :(
<Wormnest> Yeah I should have a look sometime that´s obvious
