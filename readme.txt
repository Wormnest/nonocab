NoNoCAB is a competitive AI which uses trains, trucks, buses, aircraft and ships.

This is a forked version of NoCAB which fixes the most annoying bugs and crashes
of the OpenTTD AI NoCAB. NoCAB is in general a very well performing AI but it
has some problems which have made it less fun to use.

Since there hasn't been any progress in a while I decided to see if I could do
something about the biggest problems especially the crashing while saving.
Besides that lots of other problems have been fixed and improvements have been made.

Details about all changes can be found in my forked repository:
https://bitbucket.org/jacobb/nocab/overview

I am not aware of any crashes still appearing but please report any
problems that you encounter.
